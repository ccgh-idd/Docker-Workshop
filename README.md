# Docker-Workshop
A hands-on introduction to Docker Container Toolset

---------------------------------------------------

This workshop identifies some of the core problems of computational research work that benefits from Docker utilisation. 

Three entry-level exercises demonstrate 

1.) the basic Docker work-case, 

2.) using docker for environment portability and preservation and 

3.) Using Docker to build a simple pipeline of two contained computational environments. 

---------------------------------------------------

No prior knowledge of Docker is required. The workshop utilises command line interface, but all necessary commands are explained in the materials.

---------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------

1. Computer with administrator access
